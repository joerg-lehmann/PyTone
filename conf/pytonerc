# sections.

# type: type of database: "local", "remote", "off"

# the different database types have different options, summarized in the following

# type = local: local bsddb database
#
# basename:                 Prefix of the files used for the song database. The
#                           actual files are named "<songdbbase>_songs.db" and
#                           "<songdbbase>_artists.db",  etc. Set this to an empty
#                           value, if you want to use the dbfile option.
# dbfile:                   Name of the database file which contains all databases.
#                           Set this to an empty value, if you want to use the
#                           basename option.
# dbenvdir:                 Name of the directory for the bsddb database
#                           environment. Note that every database must have
#                           its own database environment directory!
# musicbasedir:             basedir for filesystem based navigation and auto
#                           registering of songs in database.
#                           !!! You have to adjust this setting !!!
# tracknrandtitlere         Regular expression used for obtaining track nr and title 
#                           from the song filename.
# tags_capitalize:          Should the artist, album and song names  be capitalized
#                           automatically.
# tags_stripleadingarticle: Should a lead "The " be striped from the artist name.
# tags_removeaccents.       Should accents be removed in artist, album and song
#                           names.
# autoregisterer:           start song and playlist autoregisterer?
#                           If yes, PyTone tries to find new songs and playlists
#                           in musicbasedir when it is started.
#                           You may want to disable the automatic song registering
#                           after you have once populated your database. Then, you 
#                           register new songs using the -r (--rebuild) command
#                           line option. Alternatively, you can press "u" to update
