- FLAC: finish decoder when not using it any more
- release device at end of playback (Dag Wiers)

TOCHECK:
- what happens to mpg123 when pytone crashes
- song is not registered as currently being played, when its playback
  is resumed after a restart of PyTone (in particular, player window
  titlebar is wrong)
- update playingtime when updating song!

USER WISHLIST:

- allow user to turn the secondary player on and off (or alternatively to stop it)
  (requested by Stuart Pook)
- streaming sources
- Fish: Song der auf zweitem Player kommt, anzeigen
- Tomas Menzl <xmenzl at aldebaran dot feld dot cvut dot cz>:
  o show number of albums etc
  o handle collections better
- start not at beginning but a few seconds later when prehearing song
- fade out at exit (Dag Wieers <dag@wieers.com>)
- enhance crossfading such that pauses between songs can be inserted 
  (Rene Maurer <rm@cumparsita.ch>)

- General:
  o timer interface
  o user authentication and permissions
  o allow up- and download of songs
  o make automatic backups of database
  o database reconstruction
  o undo for playlist changes
  o take metadata in song hash
  o can we get rid of setDaemon
  o do not use database "main" in pytonectl
  o check whether we can merge dbrequestsongs and dbrequestlist in songdb.py

- Performance improvements:
  o move number of decades, genres, playlists (do it like for songs)
  o make length calculation of filtereddecade and filteredgenre smarter

- UI Improvements:
  o improve behaviour on scroll bar mouse clicks
  o scrollbars are sometimes too short
  o list of seldomly played songs
  o make showing of last added list configurable (similarly for rest)
  o visual indicator that PyTone is busy
